# Yeoman Projects

#### This extension adds a `File > New > Yeoman Project...` menu item

![](screen0.png)

#### Alternatively you can use `Create new > yeoman project...` on the `Start Page`

![](screen1.png)

## Using the extension

When you select the menu option a command window will open and run the **`yo`** command.

[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) will list all the Yeoman [generators](https://yeoman.io/generators/) (project templates) installed on your machine and prompt you to select one. 

Once selected you'll be prompted for a name for your new project.

Depending on the generator you choose you may be asked additional customization questions.

Finally [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) will create your new project in your default Visual Studio new project directory.

## Prerequisites

##### Npm

Yeoman relies on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you'll need to [download and install](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) npm. 

You can get started with npm [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/).

##### Yo

To create a new [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) project you'll need to install yo using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install -g yo`

You'll also need one or more Yo [generators](https://yeoman.io/generators/). For example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install -g generator-angular-basic`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install -g generator-webapp`

As Yeoman is language agnostic and can generate projects in any language (Web, Java, Python, C#, etc.) there are many generators [available](https://yeoman.io/generators/).

You can get started with Yeoman [here](https://yeoman.io/learning/index.html).
